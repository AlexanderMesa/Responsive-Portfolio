    <p>
        I was born in Goose Creek, SC. I moved to Cary, NC when I was nine years old. I graduated from Apex High then from NC State with a degree in Chemical Engineering. I have two younger sisters, Claudia and Andrea.

        One of my favorite things to do when I have down time is to go running. In fact, I was on the cross country team in high school. One of my goals is to run a marathon. Hopefully, I will have the time to do that.
